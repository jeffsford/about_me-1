    <p><strong>Professional: </strong> Nothing easy is worth doing.  I am dedicated to my challenging myself every day.  Some say I'm fanatical about my work, but is it really work if you love what you're doing?  Nothing can match the satisfaction of giving everything you have to a project and seeing it succeed.  I've dedicated my life to a constant pursuit of that feeling</p>
    <p>I spent 10 years in the military and another 3 years in private sector operations.  If there's one thing it taught me it's not to wast a minute of your tie on projects that are not contributing to your goals and/or personal satisfaction.  I had great experiences in my career and looking foward to many more.  See below for a list of some of my positions I have held:
      <ul>
        <li>Sunrun: Foreman</li>
        <li>National Guard: Team Leader</li>
        <li>Marine Corp: Team Leader</li>
      </ul>

  <p><strong>Personal: </strong> Though I love to work, there's not much point if you don't know how to play.  There are an abundant amount of activities I enjoy, but at the end of the day as long as I'm outside and being active, I'll be happy.  Below are some of my top favorites: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Snowboarding</li>
      <li>Skydiving</li>
      <li>Gaming</li>
      <li>Back Packing</li>
    </ul>
  <p><strong>Goals: </strong>Goals are essential to buiding my dreams and constructing the life I want.  I am committed to my goals and relentelss in pursuing them.  I only hope to work with like-minded people that are as driven as I am.  Following are my top 3 goals in order of priority:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Graduate from Code Fellows</li>
      <li>Find a job at a progressive and innovative tech company</li>
      <li>Create my own health and fitness business</li>
    </ol>
